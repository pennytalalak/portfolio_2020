              <p>
                Loccoli is an online grocery store app for local farmers and
                grower enthusiasts who are looking to start, promote and expand
                their local fresh produced business. Apart from creating online
                fresh produced store, the app introduces the opportunity for
                anyone to list unwanted items to give away as well. The app
                allows sellers to list their items and create their store where
                buyers can search and explore local stores. We have incorporated
                both delivery service and pick-up features. Ultimately, we aim
                to establish the emotional connection between local producers
                and consumers so that understanding the food source and their
                stories could potentially draw consumers to purchase locally
                produced.

              <h1 class="portfolio-single-heading">Role</h1>
              <p>
                In a multi-disciplinary team of 4 (mechanical engineering,
                industrial design and landscape architect students), my role is
                to over look the user experience design of the app through
                wireframing and finishing the aesthetic touch with styling the
                user interface.

              <h1 class="portfolio-single-heading">Background Research</h1>
              <p>
                Aligning with the WWF One Planet Living Principles of Local and
                We gathered our initial research from scientific papers and
                looking for an existing innovative solution. As a broad topic,
                there are two areas that affects food system; peopleâ€™s diet and
                food production. Within the given timeframe, we wanted a
                solution that can connect to individuals whilst making an impact
                at a global scale. Thus, approaching food systems by adopting
                the perspective of diets can bring operational insights to the
                issue of the evolution of food systems towards sustainability.
                Diets can be a good entry point to see what can be done
                individually and collectively to improve food systems and thus
                leading to a sustainable practice.

              <h1 class="portfolio-single-heading">Empathise</h1>
              <p>
                To understand the current's dieting habit, We conducted two
                interviews to collect personas where one practises sustainable
                food lifestyle and another does not. This is to compare and
                understand the intended users and evaluating their pain points
                and needs to assist in deriving the initial ideation phase.

              <p>
                The interview process has really opened us opportunity to
                identify the gap for sustainable food practise. Though both
                interviewees are different, both still poses a challenge to
                practise sustainable food. The common challenge is the access to
                local food, which had been reported time consuming. Another
                factor was also food waste. As these two individuals are
                independent in their own lifestyle,left over food tends to be
                the issue. There seems to be a lack of community that engage in
                sustainable practise as well as the people surrounded by them.
                Though local food stores are abundant aorund Sydney, it was the
                lack of awareness and practices from the people that can affect
                the individual's choice of dieting habit.

                <b>Problem Statement</b>
                <p>
                  How might we make it easier for people to access locally
                  sourced fresh produce?
                </p>

              <h1 class="portfolio-single-heading">Ideate</h1>
              <p>
                The 4 of us from the group all went away to come up with our own
                ideas. Such ideas include a local fresh food section withint the
                supermarket, an app that delivers local fresh produce and an app
                that published your shopping list items and matched with
                unwanted items.
              </p>
              <p>
                We presented these ideas back to the user we have previously
                interviewed to collect feedbacks and improvement.It was then
                decided as a team that we combined the two apps idea. From then
                on, Loccoli was born.

              <br />
              <p>
                The main feature of the app will align with the problem
                statement: to promote local fresh produce and make it accessible
                for everyone. Thus, we have
                <b>two main users: seller and buyer.</b>
                These two main users are able to switch the interface that is
                designed for each purpose.

                    encourage the user to use the pick-up service to reduce

                    Local farmers that have already established their business
                    looking to expand their products and connect with consumers
                    can use Loccoli to do so. The seller feature allows any
                    listing to be made, create events and communicate with
                    consumers. To increase in trust, credibility and reputation,
                    we have also developed a rating and badging system depending
                    on the membership payment.
