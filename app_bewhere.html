              <p>
                The app was an idea to help raise awareness of sexual
                harassment/violence in public space, mainly targeting women.
                After studying the case together as a group, this app would
                allow further study into different locations collecting data
                from ratings, reports and status updates. Using the phone's GPS
                location, the app will automatically ask you to rate the current
                location first before using the app itself. Users can see the
                status update of recent incidents from friends as well as
                anonymous depending on your set area radius.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h1 class="portfolio-single-heading">Objective</h1>
              <p>
                The objective of this project is to present a technological
                intervention to solve problems within the harrassment of women
                in public space.
              </p>

              <h1 class="portfolio-single-heading">Background Research</h1>
              <p>
                Public urban space should generally be accessible to all types
                of people. The experience of public space can be shaped by the
                dimensions of one’s identity, racism, sexism, ableism,
                homophobia and ageism which are often excluded in public space.
                In the 21st century, there is a rapid urbanisation taking place
                throughout the world where safety has become the main concern
                especially for women. Across the news and media, violence
                against women has become a part of everyday life. Limitations in
                women participating a social environment can derived from the
                fear of sexual harassment when simply walking on the city
                streets, selling their goods or commuting on public transports.
                This impact their right to freedom movement which can ultimately
                lead to poor opportunity for work and education suffer.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the UN Women research, 92% of women had experienced
                sexual harassment in their lifetime (UN Women), 30% of
                Australian girls and young women ages 15-19 in a survey
                commissioned by Plan International and Our Watch agreed that
                “girls should not be in public places after dark”.

                <p>
                  How might we raise awareness of sexual harrassment to women in

                This app can be seen beneficial for government use and for Built
                Environment industries. The security department can then take
                these data and predict the risk and assess the impact of the
                place in order to project the people. The data is a channel to
                provide a way harrassment can be minimise in the public space.
                Urban designers can then take these data to upgrade and renovate
                the urban space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not only for government benefits but also for women out there
                who are constantly feeling unsafe when out in a public space. As
                the definition of the public space is designed to be inclusive
                for everyone, women or any other gender and race, shouldn't feel
                obligned to use the space due to the feeling of unsafe. This app
                allows the users to help raise awareness of the surroundings but
                also a decision making platform when planning to travel to
                anywhere.

              <h1 class="portfolio-single-heading">Improvement</h1>
              <p>
                If I had more time working on this app, I would start with a
                user research and interview to understand what it really is like
                to be in the shoes of those people who are experiencing
                harrassment in public space.
              </p>
              <p>
                This app does not have an immediate action to stop the
                harrassment in public space but also provides an online tool to
                help raise awareness. There are many types of harrassment and
                this app certaintly does not solve for ever type of harrassment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Business model is also another factor if this app was to be
                taken further into development. Currently there is no business
                model.
