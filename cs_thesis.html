              <p>
                This research aims to explore the possibilities of data
                sonification for wayfinding in a public space. An example of
                data will be derived from the open data source of NSW Transport
                Data API which will be combined with GPS data to provide a
                real-time environment. Ultimately, the research aims to
                demonstrate the perception of soundscape as a way to improve
                wayfinding but can also be potentially relevant for visually
                impaired people.

              <h1 class="portfolio-single-heading">Background Research</h1>
              <p>
                In the twenty-first century, the everyday use of mobile digital
                technologies has influenced how people make wayfinding decisions
                in the urban environment. Technologies such as Google maps,
                geographic positioning systems (GPS), and dynamic forms of
                digital signage are now implicated in the decisions people make
                about where to go and how to get there. While these ubiquitous
                tools are efficient and beneficial in navigation performance,
                they are vision centric which reduces situation awareness.
                According to Centre for Road Safety — Pedestrian Trauma Trends
                Report 2017, pedestrian fatality rate increases in average of
                15% every 5 years due to mobile phone use and these numbers are
                rising. Similarly for drivers, research from Nasar and Troyer
                (2013) confirms the higher rates of accidents when mobile phones
                are activated while driving. In addition to risks within
                utilising a visual device for wayfinding, the process does not
                accommodate people who are vision impaired or cannot read.

                  Before going in the interview, I have made a couple of
                  assumptions.

                  <li>
                    People are relying on visual navigation tool to identify the
                    point of interest (POI) as well as to acquire knowledge
                    about it.

                  <li>
                    People are often at higher risk when using visual navigation

                  <li>
                    People are listening to music on their daily commute or
                    during their navigation process

                <p class="portfolio-single-heading">
                  I interviewed 12 people mainly students from class and a
                  couple of work colleague in this process. The interview was
                  structured in a conversational way to gain more insights into
                  the topic and their experience. The questions were set
                  starting off with their journey to navigating, hazards and
                  challenges and concluded with audio related question. Most of
                  the interviewers travel via train station and have not
                  actually encountered accidents but are at higher risks.
                  Examples of risks include bumping into a pole, walking into
                  people and crossing the road at green lights. The most
                  challenging part is orientation of the map and matching the
                  map with outside environment. I have also found that there are
                  many steps in navigation process and multiple touch point with
                  the app.

                After interviweing 12 users, I have gone into more details about
                each specific user for each mode of transport. An extensive
                analysis of user personas are created for users who travel via
                bus, train and via car. This crucial step allows me to
                understand their specific needs and what their daily commute is
                like.

              <p>
                To further analysis the user persona, I have picked Persona 3 to
                analyse the user's journey of navigating while driving in
                details. This is significant so that pain points are identified.
              </p>

              </center>
              <br />
              <p>
                From the table below, navigation process can be divided into 3
                categories: the planning phase (which normally takes a day
                before to plan out the trip), then the 'get ready' phase (which
                is the moment before the user leave the origin), and finally the
                navigation phase (while the user performs navigation). We see
                that Google Maps is a prime tool to plan out the journey and is
                predominantly used for searching for the destination's location,
                fastest route, and time. Then the device is being used again the
                moment before the user leave to check for real-time data such as
                traffic and finally, the device is used throughout the
                navigation process.
              </p>

              <p>
                Main problems to take from this analysis conclude that there are
                multiple stages of interaction with the Google Maps where it is
                heavily visual. A repetition can be seen where the user had to
                re-type or input the destination twice during the planning phase
                and the 'get ready' phase. During navigation, the user is at
                high risk when driving. Pain points can be seen towards the end
                of the journey where destination can be challenging to locate
                due to multiple task in cognitive mapping in order to match the
                visual map and the real-time environment.

                  was able to combine the results and ideate the output for my
                  solution. I wanted my solution to reduce planning phase so
                  that any repetition of re-typing the location can be
                  minimised. The solution should allow the user focus less on
                  the digital device so that the user can concentrate on the
                  outside environment, thus lower the risks. Lastly, the device
                  should provide a one stop solution that returns a singular
                  response instead of multiple options. This will help the user
                  with decision making process during the rushing and
